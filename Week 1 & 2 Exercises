Exercise 1

My name is John, so the first and last letter of my name (J + N = 10 + 14) give the number  24. The 24th Fibonacci number is 46368.

The code for Exercise 1....

# Ian McLoughlin

# A program that displays Fibonacci numbers.
def fib(n):

  """This function returns the nth Fibonacci number."""

  i = 0
  j = 1
  n = n - 1
  while n >= 0:
    i, j = j, i + j
    n = n - 1
  return i
# Test the function with the following value.

x = 24
ans = fib(x)
print("Fibonacci number", x, "is", ans)


Exercise 2

# John O'Neill... Exercise 2 loaded to GitHub 120218
def fib(n):

  """This function returns the nth Fibonacci number."""
  i = 0
  j = 1
  n = n - 1
  while n >= 0:
    i, j = j, i + j
    n = n - 1
  return i
name = "O'Neill"
first = name[0]
last = name[-1]
firstno = ord(first)
lastno = ord(last)
x = firstno + lastno
ans = fib(x)
print("My surname is", name)
print("The first letter", first, "is number", firstno)
print("The last letter", last, "is number", lastno)
print("Fibonacci number", x, "is", ans)

My surname is O'Neill The first letter O is number 79 The last letter l is number 108 Fibonacci number 187 is 538522340430300790495419781092981030533
ord() short form of 'ordinal' which means a number defining the position of something in a series, such as ‘first’, ‘second’, or ‘third’. 
This function is useful for converting a single character to it’s corresponding ASCII value...The ASCII table has 128 characters, with values from 0 through 127. 
Thus, 7 bits are sufficient to represent a character in ASCII;
O on ASCII Table = 079, l = 108... used to calculate the Fibonacci Number.
