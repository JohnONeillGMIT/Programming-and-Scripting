My surname is O'Neill The first letter O is number 79 The last letter l is number 108 Fibonacci number 187 is 538522340430300790495419781092981030533
ord() short form of 'ordinal' which means a number defining the position of something in a series, such as ‘first’, ‘second’, or ‘third’. 
This function is useful for converting a single character to it’s corresponding ASCII value...The ASCII table has 128 characters, with values from 0 through 127. 
Thus, 7 bits are sufficient to represent a character in ASCII;
O on ASCII Table = 079, l = 108... used to calculate the Fibonacci Number.
