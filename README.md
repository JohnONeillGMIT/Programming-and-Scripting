#### Completed [Python](https://www.python.org/) Exercises to 8 April 2018 in Programming and Scripting Module
##### Note: the .py files are set out in format **ExerciseWeek1.py to ExerciseWeek6.py**
##### nearly all changes to github repository were made through manual uploads as opposed to using git...


#### Exercises for Weeks 1&2 complete (ExerciseWeek1.py)
**Fibonacci Sequence:** This demonstrates the [Fibonacci Def.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
ExerciseWeek1: Demonstrates the Fib Function with code taken directly from lecture notes and amended slightly - intro to variables
ExerciseWeek2: Demonstrates the ASCII coding and ord functionality...shows the numbers /character assignment



#### ExerciseWeek3 (ExerciseWeek3.py)
**Collatz Conjecture** This demonstrates the [Collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
Code uses the While and If/Else loops to calculate the sequence of Integers, also shows how to assign the Class



#### ExerciseWeek4 (ExerciseWeek4.py)
Lowest Common Multiple example (for numbers 1-20 specifically) using Range and While loops.. seeing the use of Continue/Break functionality for first time, and True/False to drive through thr loop.



#### Exercise Week5 - there are *2 versions* of the code loaded in ExerciseWeek5.py
CSV file read/write and formatting of lines into Elements and columns/rows through the uses of splits, strips,delimiters, and the importance of opening closing files correctly (not to mentiaon the importance of saving down the csv files correctly !). This code brings in the use of the CSV Import and format functionality.
Shows specific use of offset coding and floating point formatting to improve to visual aspect of the print outputs. 



#### Exercise Week6 - (ExerciseWeek6.py)
**Factorials Exercise:** demonstrates the use of a defined function to be "generic" in nature.
User is asked for an Integer input and returns the result of the Factorial function
Idea is to to keep the code easily adaptable and key to effective coding to reuse similar calculations
